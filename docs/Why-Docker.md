The Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard (see Open Container Initiative - Open Container Initiative (opencontainers.org)). There's a surprisingly long history to the concept of containerization. 

## History
Docker was the first implementation that was feasible for the average developer to adopt quickly, hence why containerization exploded in the mid 2010s. However, since then, quite a few players have entered the market. Surprisingly, Docker isn't even on the list of CNCF graduated container runtime environments! See CNCF Landscape (the "Container Runtime" section). The reason devs still almost universally use Docker, though, is that Docker (like all other container runtimes) implements the OCI specification, making docker images interoperable across container runtimes.
