# How MkDocs and GitHub Actions Build a Website

## TLDR
MkDocs converts Markdown files into a static website, while GitHub Actions automates workflows. Together, they streamline the process of building and deploying documentation websites, ensuring they're always current and accessible.

## MkDocs Overview
- **MkDocs** is a static site generator that converts Markdown files into a static HTML website.
- It simplifies the process of creating and maintaining documentation websites by allowing you to write content in Markdown format.
- MkDocs uses a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file to define settings such as the site name, theme, navigation structure, and any plugins to use.

## GitHub Actions Overview
- **GitHub Actions** is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository.
- Workflows are defined using YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
- Workflows consist of one or more jobs, each containing a series of steps to be executed.

## Building the Website with MkDocs
- To build a website using MkDocs, you typically start by creating a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file in your project directory.
- This file contains settings such as the site name, theme, navigation structure, and any plugins to use.
- You write your documentation content in Markdown files, organized into a directory structure.
- When you're ready to build your website, you run the `mkdocs build` command in your terminal.
- MkDocs reads the configuration file and Markdown files, processes them, and generates a static HTML website in a directory called `site` by default.
- This static website can then be hosted on any web server or platform that supports static content, such as GitHub Pages.

## Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions allows you to automate the process of building and deploying your MkDocs website using workflows.
- You create a workflow file (typically named `main.yml` or similar) in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
- The workflow file defines when the workflow should run (e.g., on every push to a specific branch) and the series of steps to execute.
- Within the workflow, you specify steps to check out the repository code, set up any necessary dependencies (e.g., Python and MkDocs), build the MkDocs site, and deploy the built site.
- For deploying to GitHub Pages, you can use actions such as `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`, which simplifies the process of deploying static content to GitHub Pages.
- The GitHub Actions workflow runs whenever the specified trigger conditions are met (e.g., on every push to the main branch).
- Once the workflow executes successfully, your MkDocs website is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages, making it accessible to your audience.

By combining MkDocs with GitHub Actions, you can streamline the process of creating, updating, and deploying documentation websites, ensuring that your content is always up-to-date and easily accessible to your users.
